This repository represent the projects I'm working on while learning HTML/CSS/Javascript in Academy Pittsburgh, session 9, which started in week 7.

The file naming scheme always starts with the week-day of academy pittsburgh. So for example, a file starting with "7-2" means it was created on week seven, day two.

Files in the repository:
